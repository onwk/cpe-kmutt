2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin nolabel_line35/led_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line35/led[5]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line35/led_reg[0]/CLR, nolabel_line35/led_reg[1]/CLR,
nolabel_line35/led_reg[2]/CLR, nolabel_line35/led_reg[3]/CLR,
nolabel_line35/led_reg[4]/CLR, nolabel_line35/led_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
